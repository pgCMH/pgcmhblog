The Sept meeting will not be held this month. Instead, we've worked with PGConf US and Ohio Linux Fest to bring the first ever PostgreSQL conference to Ohio!

The inaugural PGConf US Local: Ohio Conference (PGConf Ohio) will be held September 29th - 30th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus Ohio (350 North High Street Columbus, Ohio, USA, 43215). 

 This two day, single track conference is a perfect opportunity for users, developers, business analysts, and enthusiasts from Ohio to amplify Postgres and participate in the Postgres community.

Friday's sessions are paid training classes taught be core PostgreSQL devs, while Saturday's sessions feature topics and guest speakers from around the community. You can read all about the talks [here](https://pgconf.us/conferences/Ohio2017/schedule/events).

We sincerely hope *everyone* comes out and supports the conference so we can make this a recurring event.

See you there!
