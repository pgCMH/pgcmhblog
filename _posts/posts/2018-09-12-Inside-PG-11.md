The Sep meeting will be held at **18:00 EST on Tues, the 25<sup>th</sup>**. Once again, we will be holding the meeting in the community space at CoverMyMeds. *Please RSVP on [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/postgresCMH/events/bjbmcmyxmbhc/) so we have an idea on the amount of food needed.*

What
----

CoverMyMeds' very own [Andy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-thissen-3a70174/) will be presenting this month. He's going to tell us all about the upcoming major PostgreSQL release 11. You'll definitely want to attend this one to find out all that's new and cool in the upcoming release!



Where
-----

CoverMyMeds has graciously agreed to validate your parking if you use their garage so please park there:

 **You can safely ignore any sign saying to not park in the garage as long as it's after 17:30 when you arrive.**

_Park in any space that is not marked '24 hour reserved'._

Once parked, take the elevator/stairs to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor to reach the Miranova lobby. Once in the lobby, the elevator bank is in the back (West side) of the building. Take a left and walk down the hall until you see the elevator bank on your right. Grab an elevator up to the 11<sup>th</sup> floor. _(If the elevator won't let you pick the 11<sup>th</sup> floor, contact Doug or CJ (info below))._ Once you exit the elevator, look to your left and right; one side will have visible cubicles, the other won't. Head to the side _without cubicles_. You're now in the community space:

The kitchen is to your right (grab yourself a drink) and the meeting will be held to your left. Walk down the room towards the stage.

**If you have any issues or questions with parking or the elevators, feel free to text/call Doug at +1.614.316.5079 or CJ at +1.740.407.7043**
