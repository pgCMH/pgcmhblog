I've been kicking around the idea of founding a Columbus-based PostgreSQL User Group for a while now. I even went so far as to float the idea to people at [OLF](http://www.ohiolinux.org) in '14. After much hemming and hawing (and no one else stepping up in the interim), I've finally gone and done it.

pgCMH is the name of my newly formed group, and we're good to go. We've got our own Twitter ([@pgCMH](http://www.twitter.com/pgCMH)):

{% twitter https://twitter.com/pgCMH/status/791654418731065344 %}

as well as our own [MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/postgresCMH) page. We've got a sponsor providing food, and another providing the meeting location. Our first meeting will be in Jan, thanks to all the scheduling conflicts the upcoming holidays create.

Watch this space for updates, follow our Twitter, and join the mailing list on MeetUp. I'd love to get your participation and input. Let's make this group as wildly successful as we can!
