pgCMH held its first ever meeting last nite at [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com) in downtown Columbus. We had an attendance of 10 members (out of 16 that had RSVP'd) and the meeting lasted slightly longer than the hour that was planned. Everyone present had a chance to introduce themselves to the group, explain their PostgreSQL "comfort level", and provide feedback into what they hoped to gain from the group. In all, it was a very productive meeting!

pgCMH looks forward to seeing everyone again next month, on Feb 28!
