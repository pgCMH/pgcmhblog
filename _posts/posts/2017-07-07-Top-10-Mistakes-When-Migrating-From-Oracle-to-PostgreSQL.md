Parking
-------

Please park at a meter on the street or in the parking garage (see below). **You can safely ignore any sign saying to not park in the garage as long as it's after 17:30 when you arrive.** Park on the first level in any space that is *not* marked '24 hour reserved'. Once parked, take the elevator to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor to reach the Miranova lobby.

Finding us
----------

**You do not need to check-in at the desk. In fact, they'll probably tell you they don't know of a meeting. Just skip the front desk completely.**

The elevator bank is in the back (West side) of the building. Take a left and walk down the hall until you see the elevator bank on your right. Grab an elevator up to the 11<sup>th</sup> floor. Once you exit the elevator, look to your left and right. One side will have visible cubicles, the other won't. Head to the side _without_ cubicles. You're now in the community space. The kitchen is to your right (grab yourself a drink) and the meeting will be held to your left. Walk down the room towards the stage.

**If you have any issues or questions with parking OR THE ELEVATORS, feel free to text/call Doug at +1.614.316.5079**
