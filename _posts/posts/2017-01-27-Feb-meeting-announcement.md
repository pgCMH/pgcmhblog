The Feb meeting for pgCMH will be held on Tues, Feb 28. Once again, we'll be holding the meeting at 18:00 EST in the 11th floor community space at [CoverMyMeds](http://www.covermymeds.com).

This will be our first presentation for the group! Jeff Klukus will be presenting a talk on *Analytics Infrastructure Powered by Logical Decoding and Kafka*. You might know Jeff as an engineer at [Simple](https://www.simple.com/) or from his work helping to discover the [Higgs particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) at the  [LHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider). Jeff is graciously presenting his talk to pgCMH as a precursor to giving it at this year's [PGConf US](http://www.pgconf.us/conferences/2017/program/proposals/294).

*Please RSVP for the meeting on [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/postgresCMH/events/237191160/)*

Hope to see everyone there!
