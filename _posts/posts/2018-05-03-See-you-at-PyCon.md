Hey everyone! Just a quick note to let you all know that both CJ and myself are manning the PostgreSQL community booth at this year's PyCon next week in Cleveland, OH.

The Python and PostgreSQL communities have a long history together, and we're super excited to be able to represent PostgreSQL at the largest annual gathering of Pythonistas. If you can make the drive, come on up to Cleveland, say hi, and learn some Python!
