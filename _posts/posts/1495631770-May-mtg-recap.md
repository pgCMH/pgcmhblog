The May "Intro to PgBouncer" meeting was held last night in the community space at CoverMyMeds. We wish to thank everyone who attended and hope the presentation was informative.

While we were not able to properly record the presentation for posterity, the slides of the presentation are available online [here](https://prezi.com/hudqfcujchnm/intro-to-pgbouncer/).

We're currently working on a guest speaker for June's meeting, so watch this space for the announcement sometime after the hokiday. Have a safe and happy Memorial Day!
