The Oct meeting will be held at 18:00 EST on Tues, the 24<sup>th</sup>. Once again, we will be holding the meeting in the community space at CoverMyMeds. Please RSVP on [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/postgresCMH/events/237322157/) so we have an idea on the amount of food needed.

Topic
-----

This month, we'll be discussing the recently released PostgreSQL 10. We'll talk about the key features in this release, some enhancements to existing features, and the backwards-incompatible changes that were made. This looks to be a *significant* release, so you'll want to start looking at and testing it sooner rather than later!


Parking
-------

Please park at a meter on the street or in the parking garage (see below). **You can safely ignore any sign saying to not park in the garage as long as it's after 17:30 when you arrive.** Park on the first level in any space that is *not* marked '24 hour reserved'. Once parked, take the elevator to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor to reach the Miranova lobby.

Finding us
----------

The elevator bank is in the back of the building. Take a left and walk down the hall until you see the elevator bank on your right. Grab an elevator up to the 11<sup>th</sup> floor. Once you exit the elevator, look to your left and right. One side will have visible cubicles, the other won't. Head to the side _without_ cubicles. You're now in the community space. The kitchen is to your right (grab yourself a drink) and the meeting will be held to your left. Walk down the room towards the stage.

**If you have any issues or questions with parking or the elevators, feel free to text/call Doug at +1.614.316.5079**
