I know you were all *eagerly awaiting* it.. so I've set up an Instagram account for the group. You can follow us at [https://www.instagram.com/pgcmh](https://www.instagram.com/pgcmh). Right now, we've got our very first photos up of [@PhilVacca](https://twitter.com/PhilVacca) delivering his presentation at the June meeting.

This will be a low-volume account. I can't see a huge need for tons of photos but I will post pictures of guest speakers and perhaps some PostgreSQL-related photos when I attend some of the larger community events.

Enjoy.
