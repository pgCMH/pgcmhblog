(Sorry for the delay in getting this out, work travel interfered)

I'd like to thank everyone who came out to the Streaming Replication Intro meeting in Mar. We had a lot of good questions and a lively discussion. As promised, you can find the presentation [here](https://prezi.com/_ongtc3au9pv/streaming-replication-101/). You can also see my 'streaming replication in 10 minutes' blog post that I referenced [here](https://hunleyd.github.io/posts/PostgreSQL-Streaming-Replication-In-10-Minutes/). And finally, a fully documented `recovery.conf` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/hunleyd/a11798bcb9f60c8b8a6366b155b1bf27).

See you all next month!
