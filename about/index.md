pgCMH is a PostgreSQL User Group based in Columbus, OH. It is open to any person interested in PostgreSQL regardless of their current familiarity or experience with it.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/), often simply Postgres, is an object-relational database (ORDBMS) – i.e. a RDBMS, with additional (optional use) "object" features – with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to store data securely, and to allow for retrieval at the request of other software applications. It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications (or for data warehousing) with many concurrent users.

PostgreSQL is [ACID-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) and transactional. PostgreSQL has [updatable views and materialized views, triggers, foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and other expandability](https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/).

PostgreSQL is developed by the [PostgreSQL Global Development Group](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/), a diverse group of many companies and individual contributors. It is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the [PostgreSQL License](https://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/), a permissive free-software license.

A users' group (also user's group or user group) is a type of club focused on the use of a particular technology, usually (but not always) computer-related.

Users' groups started in the early days of mainframe computers, as a way to share sometimes hard-won knowledge and useful software, usually written by end users independently of the vendor-supplied programming efforts.

Users' groups began to proliferate with the microcomputer revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s as hobbyists united to help each other with programming and configuration and use of hardware and software. Especially prior to the emergence of the World Wide Web, obtaining technical assistance with computers was often onerous, while computer clubs would gladly provide free technical support. Users' groups today continue to provide "real life" opportunities for learning from the shared experience of the members and may provide other functions such as a newsletter, group purchasing opportunities, tours of facilities, or speakers at group meetings.

As a users' group, pgCMH provides its members with the following services:
* periodic meetings
* a mailing list
* an online presence
* a Twitter account
* a Slack channel
